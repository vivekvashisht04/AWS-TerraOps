# AWS TerraOps Project - Testing Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots documenting the **Testing** phase of the **AWS TerraOps** project. These images capture the steps and outcomes of testing various components to ensure the infrastructure functions as intended.

The screenshots include:
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB) Testing:** Verifying traffic distribution across EC2 instances in different regions.
- **Route 53 Failover Testing:** Ensuring traffic is routed to the secondary region in case of primary region failure.
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Validation:** Testing scaling policies by simulating CPU load.
- **CloudWatch Alarms and Notifications Testing:** Confirming that alerts are triggered and notifications are received based on threshold breaches.

Each screenshot provides a visual record of the testing procedures and the successful validation of critical features in the infrastructure.
