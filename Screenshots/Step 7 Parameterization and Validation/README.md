# AWS TerraOps Project - Parameterization and Validation Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots documenting the **Parameterization and Validation** phase of the **AWS TerraOps** project. These images capture the steps involved in making Terraform configurations more flexible by introducing variables and validating their values.

The screenshots provide a visual guide to the following aspects:
- Creation of `variables.tf` to define configurable parameters.
- Validation checks to ensure input values meet specific criteria.
- Updates to Terraform configurations to utilize defined variables, enhancing reusability and customization of infrastructure.

Each screenshot is organized to provide a clear view of how parameterization and validation were implemented in this project phase.
